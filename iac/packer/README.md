```

## Getting Started

### 1️ - Install Packer

Install Packer on your system:
```bash
brew install packer  # macOS
sudo apt install packer  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
packer version
```

### 2 - Build a Hardened Image
•	AWS AMI:

```bash
packer build -var 'aws_region=us-east-1' templates/aws-hardened-ami.json
```

•	Azure Image:

```bash
packer build templates/azure-hardened-image.json
```

•	Docker Image:
```bash
packer build templates/docker-secure-image.json
```

## Features

```
• Automates hardened image creation for AWS, Azure, and Docker
• Enforces firewall & SSH security
• Installs security tools like fail2ban, auditd, and automatic updates
• Fully customizable scripts for specific security needs
```


## Next Steps
	•	Integrate Terraform: Deploy these images with Terraform automation.
	•	Expand Hardening: Add CIS/NIST benchmarks to security scripts.
	•	Automate Compliance: Build security scans into the image creation process.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add new security scripts, templates, or enhancements.

Security First! Let’s build secure, automated infrastructure together!

## **Final Thoughts**
This `packer/` setup allows you to **automate security image creation** across different platforms (AWS, Azure, Docker). 🎯 You can now **integrate these hardened images into Terraform deployments** or **use them for secure DevOps pipelines**.

Would you like to **add CIS Benchmarking** or **STIG compliance checks** next?
